# Templated Dynamic Array

This is a templated dynamic array class, the array can grow as necessary as new
elements are added to the array. The project also contains an iterator for the array that exists to ”refer to” or ”point
to” an existing element in the array. The required API’s are specified in the array.h file. This program also has ZERO memory leaks,
which has been tested and validated on Valgrind.
